🏦 Bank Management System (Java Desktop Application)
📌 Overview

The Bank Management System is a desktop-based application developed using Java, Java Swing, and SQL.
It simulates basic banking operations such as user registration, secure login, account management, mini statements, and withdrawals.

This project focuses on core Java concepts, GUI development, and database connectivity, making it suitable for understanding real-world desktop application workflows.

🎯 Objectives

To build a secure and structured banking system

To understand multi-page GUI navigation

To implement database-driven user authentication

To practice Java Swing + SQL integration

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

GUI Framework: Java Swing

Database: SQL (JDBC connectivity)

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

Platform: Desktop (Windows)

✨ Features
🔐 Authentication

Secure Login using ID Card Number and PIN

Input validation before authentication

Dynamic Clear button (visible only when input is present)

📝 User Registration

Multi-page Sign-Up Form (3 steps)

Collects:

Personal details

Address information

Account type and preferences

Data stored securely in the database

👤 User Dashboard

After successful login, users can:

View account details

Check mini statements

Perform withdrawal operations

Navigate back or exit safely from any screen

🧩 Application Flow

Login Screen

Sign In / Sign Up / Clear inputs

Sign-Up Process

Step-by-step registration across multiple pages

Main Menu

Banking operations access

Exit / Navigation

Controlled navigation to avoid abrupt termination

🗃️ Database Design

Stores user credentials and account details

Uses JDBC for database connectivity

Ensures data persistence across sessions

Note: Database credentials and connection logic are handled within the application code.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone or download the repository

Open the project in your Java IDE

Configure the database and JDBC connection

Run the main Java file

Ensure the database server is running before launching

⚠️ Limitations

Desktop-based (not web or cloud deployed)

No encryption for stored passwords (can be improved)

Limited banking operations (educational scope)

🔮 Future Enhancements

Convert to a web-based system (Spring Boot / MERN)

Add password hashing and encryption

Implement deposit and fund transfer features

Improve UI/UX consistency

Add admin panel for user management

📚 Learning Outcomes

Java Swing GUI design

Multi-window application handling

JDBC and SQL integration

Basic banking workflow simulation

Problem-solving with real-world constraints
